Numerical precision in-class assignment

1. Each number is represented by an ordered pair of signed integers
  a. This pair (a, b) represents [a * 10^b]

2. Operations!
  a. Multiplication -- (a1, b1) * (a2, b2) = (a1 * a2, b1 + b2)
  b. Addition (commutative)
    i. Let b1 > b2
    ii. while b1 > b2:
          subtract 1 from b1, multiply a1 by 10
          if b1 = b2, break (gives a1_new)
    iii. add a1_new to a2, bases are now the same
    iv. then (a1, b1) + (a2, b2) = (a1_new + a2, b2)
  c. Division
    i. Take the numbers (a1,b1)/(a2,b2)
    ii. Multiply a1 by 10^20 to improve precision of the final result
    iii. Perform long division to compute a1/a2
    iv. Discard the remainder, call the remaining quotient D, and return (D, b1-b2-20)
